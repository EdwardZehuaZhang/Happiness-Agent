- [ ] Define core interfaces for essential components

### Day 2: Code Generator Agent Focus
- [ ] Build minimal code generator agent with support for 1-2 languages
- [ ] Implement basic code generation capabilities
- [ ] Create simplified task schema
- [ ] Set up artifact storage mechanism
- [ ] Skip complex multi-agent workflow initially

### Day 3: Testing & Error Handling
- [ ] Implement basic test generation
- [ ] Add simplified error detection
- [ ] Create minimal feedback loop for code refinement
- [ ] Implement basic linting capabilities
- [ ] Set up simple error reporting

### Day 4: CLI & Integration
- [ ] Complete CLI interface for all essential commands
- [ ] Connect components into functional workflow
- [ ] Implement simplified artifact management
- [ ] Add status tracking and reporting
- [ ] Create basic documentation

### Day 5: Refinement & Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of workflow
- [ ] Bug fixes and performance improvements
- [ ] Documentation for core features
- [ ] Create simple examples
- [ ] Prepare for initial release

## MVP Technical Milestones

1. **Basic Code Generation Pipeline**
   - End-to-end workflow from prompt to code
   - Single-agent implementation (primarily code generator)
   - Support for 1-2 programming languages

2. **Simplified Error Detection**
   - Basic testing capabilities
   - Fundamental linting rules
   - Simple error reporting

3. **Minimal CLI Interface**
   - Essential commands (init, generate, status)
   - Artifact retrieval
   - Basic project management

## MVP Development Focus

### Key Priorities
- Working end-to-end system generating code from prompts
- Functional CLI with core commands
- Support for at least one programming language
- Basic error detection and reporting

### Deferred for Future Iterations
- Multiple specialized agents (consultant, PM bots)
- Advanced context management
- Support for multiple languages and frameworks
- Complex error analysis and self-healing
- Prompt enhancement capabilities

## MVP Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: System generates working code from simple prompts
2. **Usable**: CLI interface provides access to all core functionality
3. **Reliable**: Basic testing ensures generated code meets requirements
4. **Documented**: Core functionality is documented for users

## Relationship to Full Implementation Plan

This MVP serves as the first phase of the complete implementation plan found in `implementation-plan.md`. After completing this MVP, development will continue following the original implementation plan, with adjustments based on learnings from the MVP phase.

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Immediate Next Steps)

After MVP completion, prioritize these enhancements:

1. Add support for additional programming languages
2. Implement specialized agents (consultant, PM)
3. Enhance error analysis and code refinement
4. Add context management capabilities
5. Develop prompt enhancement features
